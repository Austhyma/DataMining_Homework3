DataMining_Homework3
=====Description====
This project implements the K-nearest-neighbors algorithm used in data-mining. It takes in two .arff files; one for testing, and one for training.
It then assigns a class label to the testing-sample based on a weighted vote of the nearest testing samples' class labels. 
The algorithm uses the Euclidean and Manhattan metrics for distance.
====================

In order to run this program, you must first put your .arff training and testing files inside this directory. Then to compute, type these commands into the command line:

  javac KNearestNeighbor.java
  java KNearestNeighbor <trainingFileName> <testingFileName>
  
The output will be in the form of a .csv formatted as such: "<ClassLabel1>_<ClassLabel2>_restuls.csv"
